So, if you don’t know about GPS tracking yet, it’s the perfect time.\n\nLet me guide you to the interesting facts about tracking with GPS and how it can help you!\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n● GPS tracking is a system where the user can monitor and track others or an asset’s live location\n\n● GPS trackers can have many forms, the most popular ones being vehicle trackers and smartphone apps.\n\n● GPS tracking is legal in most US states, depending on the usage.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n● What is GPS Tracking?\n\n● What is a GPS Tracker?\n\n● How Does GPS Tracking Help Businesses?\n\n● What are the Limitations of GPS Tracking?\n\n● Is GPS Tracking Legal?\n\n● How to Implement GPS Tracking Safely?\n\n● Final Words\n\n● FAQs\n\nWhat is GPS Tracking?\n\nGPS tracking is a system that uses a tracking device or software to locate a person's or an asset’s location. If you already know what GPS (Global Positioning System) is, then I believe it’s easy for you to understand how the tracking works.\n\nThe GPS devices use the Global Navigation Satellite System for location triangulation. Complex Satellite Navigation (satnav) communication and GPS signals are constantly shared from the GPS receivers on the tracking devices.\n\nImage:\n\nAlt: How GPS tracking devices work with Satellite Navigation and the Earth\n\nGPS satellite signals communicate with the GPS-enabled device, and a user can access the location data on another device. Essentially, anyone can use Real-time GPS tracking for personal or commercial use, provided they have permission.\n\nYes, GPS technology is not a complex tech that you can’t use.\n\nIt’s crucial to understand how GPS location tracking works because otherwise you won’t understand when it doesn’t! Because GPS tracking is not always accurate, and you’ll find out why soon!\n\nInteresting Read: How accurate is GPS tracking?\n\nWhat is a GPS Tracker?\n\nGPS trackers are portable or software-based GPS tracking systems that allow users to monitor real-time location data. The tracking device involves a GPS receiver, a screen, and a bunch of electrical components.\n\nSo, what is GPS tracking used for?\n\nThese are popularly used as vehicle tracking systems for fleet management and asset tracking.\n\nApart from vehicle tracking devices, GPS tracking software has become quite popular too. As more people are introduced to smartphone GPS technology, smartphone app GPS tracking has become easy to use.\n\nImage:\n\nAlt: multiple GPS trackers with a smartphone GPS tracking app\n\nWhether it’s for your kids, old-age parents, or pets, GPS tracking can be useful on multiple occasions.\n\nThere are different types of tracking systems. Here are some notable ones:\n\n● Smartphone app-based GPS tracker: Very easy to download and use. Suitable for both personal and commercial use cases.\n\n● Hard-wired vehicle GPS tracker: Connects directly to vehicles using onboard diagnostics (OBD-II) or other connectors. It can be both an active GPS tracker and a passive GPS tracker.\n\n● Personal GPS tracker: For kids, seniors, or belongings.\n\nIf you don’t know the difference between Active GPS and passive GPS, here you go:\n\n● Active GPS: Active trackers monitor you in real-time and offer remote monitoring.\n\n● Passive GPS: Passive trackers store the GPS and location tracking data and let it be viewed afterward.\n\nNow, let’s summarize the actual benefits of GPS tracking:\n\n● Real-time location monitoring and activity tracking\n\n● Geo-fencing and real-time notification\n\n● Improved customer success\n\n● Enhanced productivity and reduced time loss\n\n● Asset tracking and safety\n\n● Route planning and route optimization for fleet management businesses\n\nHow Does GPS Tracking Help Businesses?\n\nOkay, it’s one thing that GPS tracking is beneficial. But what are the actual areas where it can work for businesses?\n\nImage:\n\nAlt: How GPS tracking is helping businesses with asset management & route optimization\n\nThere are plenty of ways to use tracking tech in your business.
